- 👋 Hi, I’m @dkn16
- 👀 I’m interested in cosmology, especially **Epoch of Reionization**. I'm always wondering about how to fish information in an ocean of observational data, given that the EoR information is burried in a 1000-10000 strongger foreground.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to raise a new research idea.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on research of EoR.
