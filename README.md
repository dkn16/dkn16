- 👋 Hi, I’m @dkn16
- 👀 I have a broad interest in cosmology and astronomy, as well as developing data analysis and statistical inference techniques.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on [synax](synax.readthedocs.io), an automatic differentiable simulation for galactic sychrotron emission. The Galaxy and cosmology are closely related to each other, as the radio cosmological observations are all contaminated by Galactic foregrounds.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cosmology.
- 📫 How to reach me: dkn20@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn
